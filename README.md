##  🔍 What TrueCodes is? 

### 🎁 TrueCodes as a product

is portfolio of my work that suggests the client who I am, why I call myself a programmer but mainly - **what I have built so far 😍**

### 🖥️ but TrueCodes as a bunch of code

is a React web-app that is supported by Node.js (Express) server. The design had been prototyped in Figma before actually getting coded. 
Concerning front end, I would point out the animations that make your *swoosh* from one part to another smooth and clean.

## 🎛️ How to use TrueCodes? 

Well, let's start by jumping to [the web 😆](https://www.truecodes.dev)

Visiting the page on the current bookmark for the first time, *special animation* is here to welcome you! ❤️ But not everyone likes animations. Feel free to skip it by refreshing the web anytime. 

When on the landing page already, you can see there are only few options to choose, that's because I love to make things easy-to-understand and clean. So we got 3 parts offered, let's introduce 'em:

**- who I am:**

This part provides some key information 'bout me.

**- my work:**

Come and see what I have produced so far! 😍 Hovering over any of the choices makes the main part find the requested information for you and you can read all the important stuff about the project in seconds. Plus, there is a link to hop over to the web, where the project actually runs. Yes, (almost) all of my projects are there online! No need to run it yourself.

**- hit me up:**

Fill in the form and let's get in touch! I'm waiting for your message there in my e-mail! ❤️

## 🚀 What drove me? 

Bruh, I was so enthusiastic 'bout creating my own portfolio to let anyone get a taste of my work while getting to know me closer! But there were other reasons as well, of course, and **wanting to learn React was one of them**. Yes, this was my first React project, where I learnt all the key stuff concerning this super useful React framework - styled components, hooks or virtual DOM!
