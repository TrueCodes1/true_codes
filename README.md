##  🔍 What TrueCodes is? 

### 🎁 TrueCodes as a product

is portfolio of my work that suggests the client who I am, why I call myself a programmer but mainly - **what I have built so far 😍**

### 🖥️ but TrueCodes as a bunch of code

is a React web-app that is supported by Node.js (Express) server. The design had been prototyped in Figma before actually getting coded. 
Concerning front end, I would point out the animations that make your *swoosh* from one part to another smooth and clean.
