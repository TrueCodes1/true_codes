##  🔍 What TrueCodes is? 

### 🎁 TrueCodes as a product

is portfolio of my work that suggests the client who I am, why I call myself a programmer but mainly - **what I have built so far 😍**

### 🖥️ but TrueCodes as a bunch of code

is a React web-app that is supported by Node.js (Express) server. The design had been prototyped in Figma before actually getting coded. 
Concerning front end, I would point out the animations that make your *swoosh* from one part to another smooth and clean.

## 🎛️ How to use TrueCodes? 

Well, let's start by jumping to (the web 😆)[https://www.truecodes.dev]

Visiting the page on the current bookmark for the first time, *special animation* is here to welcome you! ❤️ But not everyone likes animation. Feel free to skip it by refreshing the web anytime. 

When on the landing page already, you can see there are only few options to choose, that's because I love to make things easy-to-understand and clean. So we got 3 parts offered, let's introduce 'em:

** - who I am: **

** - my work: **

** - hit me up: **
